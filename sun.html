        <h2>About the Sun</h2>
        <p>The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with temperatures reaching up to 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit) at its core. The Sun's gravitational pull keeps the planets, including Earth, in orbit around it.</p>
        <p>It is composed primarily of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%), with trace amounts of heavier elements. The Sun is crucial for life on Earth, providing the energy needed for warmth, photosynthesis, and weather patterns.</p>
