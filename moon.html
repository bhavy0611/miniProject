        <h2>About the Moon</h2>
        <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It is about 1/6th the size of Earth and is located approximately 384,400 km (238,855 miles) away from Earth. The Moon has a significant impact on Earth's tides and has been a source of fascination for humanity for millennia.</p>
        <p>The Moon has phases, which are the different ways the Moon looks from Earth. These phases include the New Moon, First Quarter, Full Moon, and Last Quarter. The phases are caused by the changing angles of sunlight hitting the Moon as it orbits Earth.</p>
